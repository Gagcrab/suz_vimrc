# Michael's vimrc
This is a hard fork of [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc), heavily
modified in a manner I prefer. 

# Installation
Clone to ~/.vim, and ensure you have no .vimrc in your home dir. You will need
to run the update_plugins.py script in the plugins subfolder to download all of
the plugins from Github.

Create and use the ~/.vim/my_config.vim file for any personal customisations.
